# HashMap
*Map: You get my key then you get my heart*

---  
### Summary  
In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an 
[associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) abstract data type, 
a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, 
also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

- Grammar:
```java
HashMap<K, V> map = new HashMap<K, V>();  
```
